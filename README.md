This is a simple Alexa Skill I made using one of the Alexa developer templates.
The user must have one of the Amazon Echo or Alexa products to use it.

Instructions:

Say, "Alexa, enable Corny Jokes."
This will enable the app on your device.
Then say, "Alexa, open Corny Jokes."
Alexa will read a joke at random from the jokes file in this repository.
